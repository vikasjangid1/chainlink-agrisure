        1. The policy will be registered by the insurer after it can be purchased.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg xs:text-base p-1 text-justify text-neutral-700">
        2. Upon purchasing a policy, the insurer will receive a track record that enables them to monitor the status of their crop data.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg xs:text-base p-1 text-justify text-neutral-700">
        *3. If any damage occurs to the insured crop during the policy period,
        the insurer will receive monetary compensation based on their claim
        settlement position. Once the insurer claims their crops through the
        portal, the remaining months of the policy will end, and there will be
        no further payment required. At that point, the policy contract will be
        terminated.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg xs:text-base p-1 text-justify text-neutral-700">
      4. Insurance claims should only be eligible for settlement if a
        significant disaster occurs within a timeframe exceeding 15 minutes.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg xs:text-base p-1 text-justify text-neutral-700">
        5. When purchasing a policy, the insurer is required to insure a minimum
        land area of 1,00,000 square feet.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg xs:text-base p-1 text-justify text-neutral-700">
        6. In the event of a claim settlement, we will payout to the insurer if
        either the wind speed or rainfall occurs first, or if both events happen
        simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg xs:text-base p-1 text-justify text-neutral-700">
        7. If any weather condition exceeds its predefined limit, the insurer
        will receive the highest amount of payment corresponding to that
        particular situation.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg xs:text-base p-1 text-justify text-neutral-700">
        8. If there is no damage to the crop, as per the policies, the insurer
        does not receive any monetary compensation.
